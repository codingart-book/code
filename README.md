# Coding Art

This is the repository for the book's code. We publish the code of all examples in the book organized by chapter and section.
This content will also be available as a Processing example library soon.

You can browse the examples by chapter here:

* Chapter [Idea to visuals](/examples/1_chapter_idea_to_visuals)
* Chapter [Composition and structure](/examples/2_chapter_composition_and_structure)
* Chapter [Refinement and depth](/examples/3_chapter_refinement_and_depth)
* Chapter [Completion and production](/examples/4_chapter_completion_and_production)
* Extras: [Miscellaneous code examples](/examples/5_extras)

## How to install the library

Download the library archive from the releases page (see [pre-release](https://github.com/codingart-book/code/releases/download/v0.0.1/CodingArt_Book.zip)) and unpack it into the Processing examples folder on your computer. This folder is usually located in your home directory and contains subfolders such as examples, libraries, tools etc.

Then restart Processing and you should be able to see the book examples in the "Contributed Examples" folder of the Examples browser (open this from File > Examples.. ).
